Final classes: When a class is declared as final, it cannot be extended by a subclass. This is useful for classes that are intended to be used as is and should not be modified or extended.

Performance: The use of a final can sometimes improve performance, as the compiler can optimize the code more effectively when it knows that a variable or method cannot be changed.

Security: The final can help improve security by preventing malicious code from modifying sensitive data or behavior.
